# Rogue Trader Generator Tools
The Rogue Trader Generator Tools is a Windows desktop application that automates all of the dice rolling from the various generators in the Rogue Trader line of roleplaying games, made by Fantasy Flight Games under license by Games Workshop. The Rogue Trader Generator Tools and its author are not affiliated with either party.

The main focus of the tools is to cover the sprawling system generation in the Stars of Inequity splatbook. Building a system by going through the book and rolling dice can take hours. The Rogue Trader Generator Tools does it for you in a fraction of a second. The generator builds a solar system according to the rules of that book and fills it with planets, system features, and even flora and fauna. 

The generator covers content from the following books:
- The Rogue Trader Core Rulebook
- Stars of Inequity
- The Koronus Bestiary (adds an alternate, more detailed method of generating Xenos. Also allows generating primitive species)
- Into the Storm (adds additional hulls and components for starship generation)
- Battlefleet Koronus (enables generation of Xenos and Chaos ships used in pirate fleets and starship graveyards)
- The Soul Reaver (adds Dark Eldar to the selection of races that can be encountered in space)

You may freely configure the generator to use only the books you wish to include. Please note that you will need the selected books to use the generated results.

To download the latest version of the generator, please navigate to the releases page found at https://github.com/TiLT42/RogueTraderGeneratorTools/releases/

# UPDATE 16.09.25
I'm currently using Copilot to migrate the app to Electron as a test. The WPF platform is getting a little old and there's still an audience for this app, so I'm hoping to modernize it a little. The master branch may become unstable during this time (but hopefully not), so if you want to avoid that, use the classic-wpf branch in the meantime. 
If you wish to contribute to the Electron update, feel free to add pull requests. I'm hoping to move away from the typical Windows layout and make this compatible with web browsers eventually, but it will take some work.
