# Rogue Trader Generator Tools
The Rogue Trader Generator Tools is a Windows desktop application that automates all of the dice rolling from the various generators in the Rogue Trader line of roleplaying games, made by Fantasy Flight Games under license by Games Workshop. The Rogue Trader Generator Tools and its author are not affiliated with either party.

The main focus of the tools is to cover the sprawling system generation in the Stars of Inequity splatbook. Building a system by going through the book and rolling dice can take hours. The Rogue Trader Generator Tools does it for you in a fraction of a second. The generator builds a solar system according to the rules of that book and fills it with planets, system features, and even flora and fauna. 

The generator covers content from the following books:
- The Rogue Trader Core Rulebook
- Stars of Inequity
- The Koronus Bestiary (adds an alternate, more detailed method of generating Xenos. Also allows generating primitive species)
- Into the Storm (adds additional hulls and components for starship generation)
- Battlefleet Koronus (enables generation of Xenos and Chaos ships used in pirate fleets and starship graveyards)
- The Soul Reaver (adds Dark Eldar to the selection of races that can be encountered in space)

You may freely configure the generator to use only the books you wish to include. Please note that you will need the selected books to use the generated results.
